# Machine-Learning-Recipes
Repo for Machine Learning Recipes with Josh Gordon from Google

Recipes were made with:
- Anaconda 4.2.0
- Python 2.7.12
- pydot 1.2.2
- graphviz 2.38.0 (Tip: on Windows add directory with dot.exe (in my case ...\Anaconda2\Library\bin\graphviz) to Path environment variable)

## Notes

#### Recipe #1

Supervised Learning Recipe consists of:

```Collect Training Data -> Train Classifier -> Make Predictions```

#### Recipe #2

Testing Data are examples used to "test" the classifier's accuracy (not part of the training data).

#### Recipe #3

Features should capture different types of information. Independent and easy to understand features are best.

Avoid useless and redundant features.
